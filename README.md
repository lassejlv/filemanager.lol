- Great icons for folders and files
- Easy to use
- Writeen with love in mind ❤️

*things i may wanna add later on*
- Drag and drop files
- Copy and paste files
- Build in terminal (idk why but it could be cool haha)
- A CLI?

## Installation

Download the latest version at the [releases page](https://github.com/lassejlv/filemanager.lol)
It's not signed at this point, so you need to allow it in the security settings on your Mac. Or run this command:

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/filemanager.app # may need to update the path
```


### Will it be available for Windows and Linux?

**NO**. This is a MacOS only app. But you can fork it and make it available for other platforms. Since it's specifically designed for MacOS, it will not be available for other platforms.
